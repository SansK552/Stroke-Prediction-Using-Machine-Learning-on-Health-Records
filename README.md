# Stroke-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-on-Health-Records
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of stroke in patients using health and demographic data. It demonstrates a full data science pipeline using SQL (BigQuery), Python, and R.

# Tools and Technologies
SQL (BigQuery) for data querying and aggregation
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn) for data processing, visualization, and model building
R (tidyverse, caret, ggplot2) for exploratory analysis, statistical validation, and model comparison
